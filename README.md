Before running the client and server files, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Running the Client

1. Open the index.html file
2. Click on Live Server button in VS Code
3. Click on the different buttons to test the API
4. Open Developer tolls using F12 or "Right Click > Inspect Element"
4. The API response can be viewed on Network tab and Console tab

The client application should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.

## Running the Server

1. Open another terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the server directory: `cd server`.
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Start the server application: `node index.js`.

The server application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
